The Assignment: Imagine yourself and your lab partner (you will be working in Groups) are about to start a small business. Choose a business and design and implement a relational database for that business. Next, you are required to create a web site (one or more web pages) to advertise for your business. Via the use of PHP, at least one page in your web site should allow the user to connect to the database and display (or add/modify) specific user-selected data from the database. Once you’ve done that, then: 

1. Submit your work in a properly structured technical report (one report is required from each group to be handed in during the lab on the Report Due Date above) providing descriptions of: 
<ol>
<li>Introduction & brief rationale, including why you chose that business? </li>
<li>The modelling and design steps of your database, using appropriate illustrations, <b><i>such as E-R diagrams</b></i>. </li>
<li>Implementation of the database using MySQL. </li>
<li>Design and development of an appropriate web site for the business, with screen shot(s) of the created web page(s). Marks will be given for appearance, ease of use, speed, functionality, and adherence to standards.</li>
<li>Creation of appropriate .php files for connecting and communicating with the database - provide the code for the .php files you created. </li>
<li>Discussion of results (including whether the system achieved is fully operational, problems encountered/aspects of the system that were not achieved and why). </li>
  <li>Conclusions: why would your database design be useful for chosen business? </li>
  </ol>

2. Prepare an 8-minute Group presentation of your work using PowerPoint. The presentations will be conducted during the usual lab slot scheduled for Tuesday, 30 November 2018.
