Autumn 2018

Database & Website Design Assignment 

Weight: 15% of the Module’s Total 
Report Due Date: Tuesday, 30 November 2018 
Failure to meet Deadline: Zero Marks 

The Assignment: Imagine yourself and your lab partner (you will be working in Groups) are about to start a small business. Choose a business and design and implement a relational database for that business. Next, you are required to create a web site (one or more web pages) to advertise for your business. Via the use of PHP, at least one page in your web site should allow the user to connect to the database and display (or add/modify) specific user-selected data from the database. Once you’ve done that, then: 

1. Submit your work in a properly structured technical report (one report is required from each group to be handed in during the lab on the Report Due Date above) providing descriptions of: 
•	Introduction & brief rationale, including why you choose that business? 
•	The modelling and design steps of your database, using appropriate illustrations, such as E-R diagrams. 
•	Implementation of the database using MySQL. 
•	Design and development of an appropriate web site for the business, with screen shot(s) of the created web page(s). Marks will be given for appearance, ease of use, speed, functionality, and adherence to standards.
•	Creation of appropriate .php files for connecting and communicating with the database - provide the code for the .php files you created. 
•	Discussion of results (including whether the system achieved is fully operational, problems encountered/aspects of the system that were not achieved and why). 
•	Conclusions: why would your database design be useful for chosen business? 

2. Prepare an 8-minute Group presentation of your work using PowerPoint. The presentations will be conducted during the usual lab slot scheduled for Tuesday, 30 November 2018. 

Summary of Assignment: 
•	Apply web design, HTML, CSS, database design/implementation and database/web interfacing skills learnt from lectures, tutorials and laboratory exercises 
•	Prepare and submit a report and prepare a short oral presentation of your work, as per Sections 1 & 2 above. 
•	Database should have 4 tables minimum. 
•	Your site should have at least two PHP pages showing interaction with the database, at least one of which accepts input from the user to function. Ideally an example of an input (INSERT) and output (SELECT) should be demonstrated.
•	Late work will not be accepted!!
